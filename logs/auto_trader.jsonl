While it is technically safe from a security standpoint, there are several significant risks to consider. The most alarming risk is that the top 10 holders own more than 70% of the token supply, which poses a danger of price manipulation. Additionally, a single holder owns 24.59% of the token supply, further increasing the risk of volatility. The liquidity is low at $55.27, indicating a lack of market depth and potential for extreme price fluctuations. The trading activity shows 1,818 buys and 2,003 sells in the last hour, suggesting some interest, but the price has dropped by 100% in the last hour, which is alarming. Other risks include high ownership concentration and low liquidity providers.
